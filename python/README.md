## Python Implementation of UCD

1. This folder contains a Python implementation of the unbiased contrastive
   divergence algorithm.
2. The Python code is mainly used to demonstrate the algorithm, and is not
   optimized for computational speed.
3. The R package was written in efficient C++ with parallel computing support,
   and should reflect the actual computational efficiency of the algorithm.
